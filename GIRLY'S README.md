## My process

### Built with

-HTML5 

-CSS3

-Google Fonts

-Flexbox

-Media Queries


### What I learned

 Styling with CSS
I learned how to use:

display: flex, justify-content, and align-items for layout.

gap, margin, and padding to create space between and around elements.

How to apply different Google Fonts to specific tags (h1, p, li, etc.).

How to use color and font-weight to style elements like <strong> and headings differently.

How to control my card size with width, max-width, and box-sizing.

Responsive Design
How to:

Add a <meta name="viewport"> tag to make mobile layout work.

Use media queries (@media) to change layout for larger screen sizes like desktops.

Ensure the design adapts well to both mobile and desktop using max-width and width: 90%

```html
<h1>Semantic HTML (like <h2>, <ul>, <strong>) makes the content easy to understand and accessible</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  All css
}
``

### Continued development

-Improve how the card scales on all devices, especially large desktops and small mobile screens.
-Organize files more cleanly â€” for example, separating CSS, images, and assets into folders.
